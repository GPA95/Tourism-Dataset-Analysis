# Tourism-Dataset-Analysis
This repository contains my project Tourism Dataset Analysis, completed during a 5-day workshop on "Data Analytics in Python" organized by IIT (BHU) in June 2024. The project focuses on analyzing hypothetical tourism data to identify trends, relationships, and patterns while leveraging Python libraries for data analytics and visualization.
